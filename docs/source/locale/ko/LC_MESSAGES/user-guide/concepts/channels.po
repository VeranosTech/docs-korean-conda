"Conda :doc:`packages <packages>`_ are downloaded from remote channels, "
"which are URLs to directories containing conda packages. The ``conda`` "
"command searches a default set of channels, and packages are "
"automatically downloaded and updated from "
"https://repo.anaconda.com/pkgs/. You can modify what remote channels are "
"automatically searched. You might want to do this to maintain a private "
"or internal channel. For details, see how to :ref:``modify your channel "
"lists <config-channels>`."
