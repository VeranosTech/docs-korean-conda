"A conda environment is a directory that contains a specific collection of"
" conda packages that you have installed. For example, you may have one "
"environment with NumPy 1.7 and its dependencies, and another environment "
"with NumPy 1.6 for legacy testing. If you change one environment, your "
"other environments are not affected. You can easily activate or "
"deactivate environments, which is how you switch between them. You can "
"also share your environment with someone by giving them a copy of your "
"``environment.yaml`` file. For more information, see :doc:`../tasks"
"/manage-environments`."
