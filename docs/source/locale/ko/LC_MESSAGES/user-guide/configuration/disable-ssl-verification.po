"disable SSL and it may be necessary to disable SSL in certain cases."

"Some corporate environments use proxy services that use Man-In-The-Middle"
" (MITM) attacks to sniff encrypted traffic. These services can interfere "
"with SSL connections such as those used by conda and pip to download "
"packages from repositories such as PyPI."

#: ../../source/user-guide/configuration/disable-ssl-verification.rst:13
msgid ""
"If you encounter this interference, you should set up the proxy service's"
" certificates so that the ``requests`` package used by conda can "
"recognize and use the certificates."

"For cases where this is not possible, conda-build versions 3.0.31 and "
"higher have an option that disables SSL certificate verification and "
"allows this traffic to continue."

"This opion causes your computer to download and execute arbitrary code "
"over a connection that it cannot verify as secure. This option is not "

"Using this option will cause ``requests`` to emit warnings to STDERR "
