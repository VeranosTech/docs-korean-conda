"There will be no channel collisions if you use only the defaults channel."

"Before conda 4.1.0 was released on June 14, 2016, when two channels "
"hosted packages with the same name, conda installed the package with the "
"highest version number. If there were two packages with the same version "
"number, conda installed the one with the highest build number. Only if "
"both the version numbers and build numbers were identical did the channel"
" ordering make a difference. This approach had 3 problems:"

"Build numbers from different channels are not comparable. Channel A could"
" do nightly builds while Channel B does weekly builds, so build 2 from "

"Users could not specify a preferred channel. You might consider Channel B"
" more reliable than Channel A and prefer to get packages from that "
"channel even if the B version is older than the package in Channel A. "
"Conda provided no way to choose that behavior. Only version and build "
"numbers mattered."

"Build numbers conflicted. This is an effect of the other 2 problems. "
"Assume you were happily using package Alpha from Channel A and package "
"Bravo from Channel B. The provider from Channel B then added a version of"
" Alpha with a very high build number. Your conda updates would start "
"installing new versions of Alpha from Channel B whether you wanted that "
"or not. This could cause unintentional problems and a risk of deliberate "
"attacks."

"By default, conda now prefers packages from a higher priority channel "
