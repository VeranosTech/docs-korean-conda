"If you are already using Travis CI, using conda is a preferable "
"alternative to using apt-get and pip to install packages. The Debian "
"repos provided by Travis may not include packages for all versions of "
"Python or may not be updated as quickly. Installing such packages with "
"pip may also be undesirable, as this can take a long time, which can "
"consume a large portion of the 50 minutes that Travis allows for each "
"build. Using conda also lets you test the building of conda recipes on "
"Travis."
