"Channels are the path that conda takes to look for packages. The easiest "
"way to use and manage custom channels is to use a private or public "
"repository on `Anaconda.org <https://anaconda.org/>`_, formerly known as "
"Binstar.org. If you designate your Anaconda.org repository as private, "
"then only you and those you grant access can access your private "
"repository."
