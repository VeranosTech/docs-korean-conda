"Conda is an open source package management system and environment "
"management system that runs on Windows, macOS and Linux. Conda quickly "
"installs, runs and updates packages and their dependencies. Conda easily "
"creates, saves, loads and switches between environments on your local "
"computer. It was created for Python programs, but it can package and "
"distribute software for any language."

"Conda as a package manager helps you find and install packages. If you "
"need a package that requires a different version of Python, you do not "
"need to switch to a different environment manager, because conda is also "
"an environment manager. With just a few commands, you can set up a "
"totally separate environment to run that different version of Python, "
"while continuing to run your usual version of Python in your normal "
"environment."

"The conda package and environment manager is included in all versions of "
":ref:`Anaconda <anaconda-glossary>`\\ |reg|, :ref:`Miniconda <miniconda-"
"glossary>` and `Anaconda Repository <https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda-"
"repository/>`_. Conda is also included in `Anaconda Enterprise "
"<https://www.anaconda.com/enterprise/>`_ , which provides on-site "
"enterprise package and environment management for Python, R, Node.js, "
"Java and other application stacks. Conda is also available on PyPI, "
"although that approach may not be as up to date."
